# SMM4Replay
Modified version of BenjaminWins11's Super Mario Maker 4 on Scratch to include recording and replaying player inputs.

## 1. Instructions
1. To create a replay, simply play through the level until the end. Once you hit the goal, a text input should appear asking if you want to save your replay code. By answering yes, you will be then asked to add a replay description. Finally, a replay code will appear on your screen. Copy it and paste it to a text area such as Notepad.
2. To load your replay code, you will have to go to the main menu and click on "Load Level". You will be asked to load the replay code if you have it, and then the level code. After doing so, human inputs will be disabled and your replay will play through the level for you (hopefully).

## 2. Known Bugs
1. Replay codes may be slightly inaccurate on some levels. However 99% of them should play through without any issues.
2. On some bosses, their movement is randomized and may lead to a replay fault. There is currently no fix for this as of now, but I am looking into it.

## 3. CONTRIBUTIONS OF ANY SORT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!
1. There could be some bugs lurking around. If you find any, please report them by making a pull request or add a comment using Issues.
2. New features would be awesome as well!

## 4. Conclusion
This is my first time modding a game in a while. However, I have wanted to port replays to SMM4 for over a year now, and I think this time around I have finally successfully done it. This project has not been uploaded to Scratch due to the project surpassing the 5MB limit.
